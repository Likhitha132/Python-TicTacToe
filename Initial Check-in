####To Design the Scoreboard

###To validate the Win or Tie situation of tic tac toe Python  
def win_validate(position_player, player_current):  
   
   # Below are all the possible winning combinations that were analyzed to win the tic tac toe Python game  
    win_combinations = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9], [1, 5, 9], [3, 5, 7]]

# User-defined function Python for validating is the tic ta toe Python game is a tie

    if len(position_player['X']) + len(position_player['O']) == 9:  
        return True

###Using the Data Structure to Store Data for a single game of tic tac toe Python

def game_single(player_current):   
    value = [' ' for i in range(9)]  

    print("\n")
    print("\n  1 | 2 | 3")
    print("\n  4 | 5 | 6")

    print("\nThe printed table above displays the format in which the numbers are set up. Let the game begin! ")
    position_player = {'X' : [], 'O' : []} 

###Game-Loop of tic tac toe. Using the while loop to call the  tictactoe_grid function whenever it remains TRUE.
    while True:  
        tictactoe_grid(value)

        try:

            continue  
   
        if value[chance - 1] != ' ':  
            print("Oops! The position is already filled. Please try again!")  
            continue  


###To update the inputs from a player into the game information of tic tac toe Python
        # Update the status of the gameboard 
        value[chance - 1] = player_current  
      
        # Update the player's position on the grid.
        position_player[player_current].append(chance)

            print("\n")  
            return player_current  
      
        # Check for Tie using UDF

            print("It was close! Game is Tied")  
            print("\n")  
            return 'D'  
 
###To validate switching between the player once the chance of one player is executed
        # using the if-else loop in Python to make the switch between the player  
        if player_current == 'X':  
            player_current = 'O'  
        else:

###To Record the Player's names to observe on the scoreboard

if __name__ == "__main__":  

  # implmenting the input function to allow the user of the game to input its name.
    print("The First Player's name")  
    player_first = input("Please type in your name: ")

    print("The Second Player's name")  
    player_second = input("Please type in your name:  ")

###To capture the game information
  # Capturing the player who chooses the  X and O  
    player_current = player_first  
   
  # Capturing the players' choice  
    player_choice = {'X' : "", 'O' : ""}

  # Storing the information that needs to be captured in the scoreboard  
    score_board = {player_first: 0, player_second: 0}  
    my_scoreboard(score_board)  
 
###For creating an Outer loop to make our game flexible and allow multiple games of tic tac toe Python to be played

  # Using the while function in Python for adding multiple series of games until the players call it an exit.
    while True:  
        # Menu displayed to the players
        print(player_current, ", you get the chance to pick X or 0 for the Tic tac toe game:")  
        print("Please press 1 for X")  
        print("Please press 2 for O")  
        print("Please press 3 to Exit the Game") 
 
###Selection of the symbol for the current player for each iteration of the game

        # The try-except block for the_choice input from the player  
        try:

                player_choice['X'] = player_first  
           
        elif the_choice == 3:
            print("\n\n")
            print("Thanks for playing the game!!!")
            print("The final scores are")

###Execution of the tic tac toe Python game and updating the scoreboard simultaneously and getting the winner
        winner = game_single(option[the_choice - 1]) 

        # Scores obtained by the winner are getting updated on the scoreboard  
        if winner != 'D' :  
            player_won = player_choice[winner]  
            score_board[player_won] = score_board[player_won] + 1 
 
            my_scoreboard(score_board)

        # Swapping between the players after each game for who will choose X or O  
        if player_current == player_first:
